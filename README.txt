Bootcake is a modified version of Usercake (http://usercake.com/)

Usercake is 100% Free and Opensource and so is Bootcake.

Bootcake uses the core framework of Usercake The main difference is I've modified Bootcake to use Bootstrap CSS and JQuery. I've also added a new PHP class called class.main.php in the includes folder which has a second OOP database class. You can either use the original Usercake procedural structure going forward or mine, both still work it's just a matter of preference and how well you understand PHP security issues. I've also added some examples of how to use PHP and AJAX to get data from the database into a format that you can easily use with JavaScript on the front end.

Some other things I've incorporated are:

underscore.js just makes life easier.

purify.php improves site security.

Animate.css for spicing up the front end.

HTML 5 Shim for compatability.

Alternate CSS Style sheets for Bootstrap.

Custom CSS buttons.
